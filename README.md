# M.A.Git
My Amazing Git(M.A.Git) is a personal Git version - based on the original Git.

# Introduction:
As a part of our Java course , we created our own version of Git platform.
Our system allows several users to manage different repositories and to control their versions across the repository history.
During this Project we learned about new Java elements such as :
* Using multiple threads in Java
* Creating desktop Application with JavaFX
* Work with several projects and 3rd side libararies
* Use of Collections,Streams,Lamda expressions
* CSS
* Usage and creation of JAR's

# Our Project:
The main goal of the system is to allow users to manage their repositories.

The system allows the user several actions such as:
* Commit and save the changes that were done on repository
* Create new empty repository
* Load repository from XML
* Work with remote repository(Collaboration)- actions like clone,fetch,push,pull are available
* Merge action between 2 commits
* Multiple Branches actions - checkout to other branch than the master, delete branch, create branch, etc

While the user is working on a specific repository, the system will show him the current commit tree that includes all the commits across the repository history.
For each commit, the system supply some usefull information like:
* User name that performed the commit
* Branch name that pointing on that commit
* The difference between the pointed commit and it's precending commit - what changes were made
* The actual content of the repository after the commit was done(The files that were available and their content)
* On what time the Commit was created
